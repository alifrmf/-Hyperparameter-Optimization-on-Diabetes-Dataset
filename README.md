**ðŸ©ºContent:**

The goal of the classification problem is to develop a model that can accurately classify patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic based on their medical information. This task is crucial in healthcare as it can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, a chronic disease that affects millions of people globally.

**ðŸ©ºThis notebook includes the following:**

- Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning
- Fine-tuning the Hyperparameters
- Model Evaluation
